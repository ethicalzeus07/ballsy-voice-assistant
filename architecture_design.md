# Full-Stack Voice Assistant Architecture with Siri-like UI

## Architecture Overview

The voice assistant system follows a modern full-stack architecture that separates concerns while ensuring seamless integration between components. The architecture consists of four primary layers:

1. **Frontend Layer**: A responsive web application with a Siri-like UI that provides visual feedback and animations
2. **API Layer**: RESTful and WebSocket endpoints that facilitate communication between frontend and backend
3. **Application Layer**: Core business logic handling voice processing, command interpretation, and service integration
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Databases, caching, and external service integrations

## Frontend Architecture

### Siri-like UI Components

The frontend implements a modern, responsive interface with the following key components:

- **Voice Indicator**: A dynamic, animated orb that responds to voice input with fluid animations
- **Response Display**: Text area that shows transcribed user input and assistant responses
- **Activation Button**: Alternative to voice activation for manual triggering
- **Visual Feedback System**: Animations that indicate listening, processing, and responding states

### Frontend Technologies

## API Layer

### RESTful Endpoints

- **/api/auth**: Authentication and user management
- **/api/voice/process**: Process voice commands (upload audio)
- **/api/commands**: Direct text command processing
- **/api/settings**: User preferences and system configuration
- **/api/history**: Conversation history management

### WebSocket Endpoints

- **/ws/voice**: Real-time voice streaming and processing
- **/ws/notifications**: Push notifications and system status updates

### API Design Principles

- **Versioning**: API versioning to ensure backward compatibility
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with meaningful messages
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## Data Architecture

### Database Schema

- **Users**: User profiles and authentication information
- **Sessions**: Active user sessions and authentication tokens
- **Conversations**: Conversation history with timestamps
- **Commands**: Processed commands and their outcomes
- **Settings**: User preferences and system configuration

### Memory Management

- **Short-term Memory**: In-memory storage for active conversations
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage for user preferences and conversation history
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed data cached for performance

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

- **Local Development**: Docker-based development environment
- **Testing**: Automated testing with pytest and Jest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

### Production Environment

- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for service orchestration
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for handling increased load
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data
- **API Security**: HTTPS, CORS, and rate limiting
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security audits of dependencies

## Integration Points
